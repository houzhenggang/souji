The layout of this package's Makefile is slightly unusual. The reason is, we
want to be able to split the ucollect into multiple packages with independent
versioning. But much of the compilation is identical.

So, we have a generic part (Makefile.common), and a top-level Makefile. The
top-level one uses the common parts. The same Makefile.common is referred from
the plugins.
